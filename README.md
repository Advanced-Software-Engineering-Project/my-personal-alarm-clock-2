Our project is an online alarm clock to keep track of usersâ€™ alarms. The users are able to enter a username and store the time for their alarm, so that they can come back later and use the same time again. The technologies we used are javascript, html, and css on the front end, and python with flask, Fabric and Redis on the backend.
